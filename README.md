# Vizia Site

This is the official repository containing the [Vizia](https://github.com/vizia/vizia) website found [here](TODO).

The website was created using the `create-svelte` template found [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte)

## ⚠️ Important Note ⚠️

This repository doesn't currently allow PRs because of it's rapidly evolving development and constant overhauls

## To-Do List:

- [ ] Update Landing Page to containg important information
- [ ] Fill FAQ section
- [ ] Fill About section
- [ ] Fill Tutorial section
- [ ] Responsive design

## Developing

Developing the website is pretty easy. First, install the dependency manager `npm` (or `yarn`) and execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will create a local server and, opening a tab on your browser, you will be able to view the website! Using the `--open` option allows to directly open the website in a new tab for you.

## Building

Once the changes are ready to take effect on the public website, all we have to do is execute the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create the `/build/` folder, which is the folder that is linked to Github Pages.

You can also preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

You can find more information about how this build process works [here](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters).
